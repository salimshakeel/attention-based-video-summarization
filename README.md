## Feature Extraction for Video Summarization

This project provides a pipeline to extract deep features from fighter jet videos to be used as input for the [PGL-SUM](https://github.com/ok1zjf/PGL-SUM) video summarization model.

## üìå Overview

The `generate_features.py` script:
- Load the video.
- Samples frames at a fixed FPS-15.
- Uses a pretrained **GoogLeNet** model to extract spatial features.
- Averages the spatial dimensions to produce a fixed-length feature vector per frame.
- Stores features in an `.h5` file, compatible with the **TVSum/SumMe** dataset format used by PGL-SUM.
